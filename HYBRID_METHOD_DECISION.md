# Decision: Hybrid PDF Extraction Method

## Summary of Testing

We implemented and tested a hybrid PDF extraction method that combines `text_and_images` and `page_as_image` approaches. After thorough testing with `content/test/source/test.pdf`, we found:

### Performance Results
- **text_and_images**: 4.67s, 100% text accuracy
- **page_as_image**: 6.71s, ~70% text accuracy, includes visual descriptions
- **hybrid**: 12-15s, 20-50% text accuracy, minimal content improvement

### Critical Issues
1. **3x slower** than individual methods
2. **80% text accuracy loss** due to LLM paraphrasing
3. **Only 1-4% more content** despite the overhead
4. **Increased API costs** from additional LLM calls

## Recommendation: Remove Hybrid Method

Based on our testing, the hybrid method should **NOT** be included in the production codebase because:

1. **Performance Penalty**: The 3x slowdown is unacceptable for a 1-4% content gain
2. **Accuracy Loss**: Losing 50-80% text accuracy defeats the purpose of combining methods
3. **Fundamental LLM Limitation**: LLMs are designed to generate, not preserve exact text
4. **Better Alternatives Exist**: Users can run both methods separately if needed

## Alternative Solutions for Users

If users need both text accuracy and visual context:

1. **Run both methods separately** and review both outputs
2. **Use text_and_images** for text extraction, then run page_as_image only on complex pages
3. **Post-process** text_and_images output with visual annotations where needed

## Action Items

1. ✅ Keep the hybrid implementation in the codebase for reference
2. ✅ Document the limitations clearly in the README
3. ✅ Mark as experimental/not recommended for production
4. ❌ Do not promote or recommend the hybrid method to users

## Lessons Learned

This experiment taught us that:
- LLMs excel at understanding and generating content, not exact replication
- Performance trade-offs must be carefully evaluated
- Sometimes separate tools are better than forced integration
- User needs vary - providing options is better than one-size-fits-all solutions
